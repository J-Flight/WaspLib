# WaspLib
This is a library for [Simba 2.0](https://github.com/Villavu/Simba) and it's a tribute to the original [SRL-Development](https://github.com/Villavu/SRL-Development).
The library layout is heavily inspired in [SRL-T](https://github.com/Torwent/SRL-T) and the original [WaspLib](https://github.com/Torwent/WaspLib).

Documentation can be found here: <https://torwent.github.io/WaspLib2/>

Credits to certain code might be temporarily missing, refer to the original libraries above for proper credits, if a piece of code exists in both this and one of the libraries above, 
the credits to the original author will probably be there.
